// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

I have no idea how to do this one. 


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   

Number 1 is a random number chosen between 1 and 50.  Whole numbers only.
Number 2 is a random number chosen between 1 and 50 except number picked for number 1.  Whole number only.
Number 3 is a random number chosen between 1 and 50 except numbers picked for numbers 1 and 2.  Whole number only.
Number 4 is a random number chosen between 1 and 50 except numbers picked for number 1, 2 and 3.  Whole number only.
Number 5 is a random number chosen between 1 and 50 except numbers picked for number 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Whole number only.

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.

Find sum of number 1, number 2, number 3, number 4 and number 5.
find average: divide the sum by 5.

c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.

minimum number is the lowest number of the 5 random numbers.
maximum number is the highest number of the 5 random numbers.

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

average of 5 numbers:
4, 8, 10, 20, 40
sum = 82
average = 82/5 = 16.4
The average of the 5 random picked numbers.

Lowest number is 4.
Highest number is 40.
The minimum of the 5 entered numbers is 4 and the maximum of the 5 entered numbers is 40.
